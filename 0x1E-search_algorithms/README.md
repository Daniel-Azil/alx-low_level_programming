# Linear Search Algorithm


## 0-linear.c

### Description:
The `linear_search` function is a custom implementation of the linear search algorithm. It searches for a target value in an array of integers and returns the index of the target value if found, or -1 if the target value is not present in the array.

## 1-binary.c
### Desciption:
This is a C program that implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target value in a sorted array.

## 2-O
### Description:
Time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

## 3-O
### Description:
Space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

## 4-O
### Description:
Time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

## 5-O
### Descrption:
Space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

## 6-O
### Description:
Space complexity of this function / algorithm.
